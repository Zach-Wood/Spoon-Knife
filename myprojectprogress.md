Project Progress

The project i am most interested in at the moment is CMake and open sourced platform developed by a local company. [

Between blessed and common repositories, i would have to go with a common repository when working with single person contributions to a local repository, but would have to go with a blessed repository when working with a large scale open source project such as CMake.
